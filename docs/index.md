# Kodi Lutris Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains how to set up [Kodi](https://kodi.tv/about) and [Lutris](https://lutris.net/about/) on a [Home Theater PC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC). The goal is to create a fast, light-weight media and gaming system for the living room.

The HTPC setup described in this guide is a setup I have been using myself for the past five years. Installing and configuring your own HTPC is a great to start using Linux. 

The guide will introduce you to topics such as:

* [x] Linux installation
* [x] Terminal commands
* [x] Program and package installation
* [x] Configuration file editing
* [x] User management

The guide is written for the Linux beginner who is dipping their toes into the ocean of Linux for the first time. Therefore, the procedures in the guide are described in detail and I have also added links to external resources where you can read up on the topics covered.
